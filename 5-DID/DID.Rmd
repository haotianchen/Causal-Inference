# Difference-in-Differences
 - Recall that the key idea of DID is comparing the changes over time in the treated group to the changes over time in the control group.
 - So we can exploit both variations: 1) cross-sectional variation within each time period, and 2) temporal variation within each unit.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
library(estimatr)
library(knitr)
library(gridExtra)

tibble(Time = rep(c(1, 2), 3),
       Group = as.factor(rep(c(1, 2, 3), each=2)),
       y = c(0, .5, 1, 1.5, 1, 3.5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Time, y=y, col=Group, linetype=Group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1.5, linetype="dashed", col="gray") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("1"="black", "2"="red", "3"="red"), 
                     labels = c("Control", 
                                "Counterfactual trajectory \n of treated in the \n absence of treatment",
                                "Treated")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("1"= "solid", "2"="dotted", "3"="solid"), 
                        labels = c("Control", 
                                "Counterfactual trajectory \n of treated in the \n absence of treatment",
                                "Treated")) +

  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face="bold", size=12),
        legend.text=element_text(size=12),
        legend.spacing.y = unit(.5, 'cm')) +

### DID example
***
 - **Malesky et al. 2014. The Impact of Recentralization on Public Services: A Difference-in-Differences Analysis of the Abolition of Elected Councils in Vietnam. APSR** ([2014](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/impact-of-recentralization-on-public-services-a-differenceindifferences-analysis-of-the-abolition-of-elected-councils-in-vietnam/3477854BAAFE152DC93C594169D64F58))

 - Question: does (re)centralization improve local public service? How the abolition of *local elected councils* (=decentralization) affects local public services in Vietnam?
 
 - In Vietnam, District People's Councils (DPC) have been devices for decentralization: political, administrative and fiscal authorities of local governments were shifted to elected local councils. But, in 2009, Vietnamese political leaders piloted a removal of DPC in 99 districts across the country (so really a social quasi-experiment!)
 
 - The authors utilize the basic (2-periods) DID design to study how the abolition of elected councils
affects local public services.

 - The DID estimator with covariates (following Chad's notation) is: $$Y = \mu + \gamma D + \delta T + \tau (D \cdot  T) + X^T\beta + \epsilon,$$ where $D$ is the (eventually) treated units indicator (1 for communes that had their DPCs abolished, 0 otherwise), $T$ is post-treatment period indicator (1 for 2010, 0 for  2008; treatment strated in 2009), $X$ is (time-invariant) covariates, and $\tau$ is our quantity of interest.

  mutate(post_treat = ifelse(year == 2010, 1, 0)) ### this variable is "Time" variable in the paper ###
```

 <br>

### Replicate main results (Table 2)
 - Variables:
    + `outcome variables` ($Y$): There are 30 outcome variables to measure local public services. For example, `transport` is a binary variable, the response to the question "Is there a passenger bus line, train or water transport that passes through the village?" `pro4` (Education and Cultural Program) is a binary variable, the response to the question "Is there the  following project in the commune?: Investment on culture and education"
    + `post_treat` ($T$): "Time" variable in the paper; 1 if 2010, 0 for 2008. Treatment was implemented in 2009.
    + `treatment` ($D$): Treatment variable, 1 for communes that had their DPCs abolished, and 0 otherwise.
    + `lnarea`: Area size of each commune.
    + `lnpopden`: Population of each commune.
    + `city`: Whether national-level city or not.
    + `reg8`: 8 regions, but one was excluded (Central Highlands) for security reasons. The models will contain regional fixed effects.
  
 - We include the interaction term of $T$ and $D$ to get the treatment effect on local public service outcomes over time.

 - They clustered SEs by district AND provinces; but let's cluster at the treatment level, i.e., district. (Perhaps we could compute SEs through block-bootstrap at the district level.)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#we use only 2008 and 2010 for analysis; 2006 data will be used to investigate parallel trends
data <- malesky2014 %>% filter(year != 2006)

#column1: All-Year Road in Commune as outcome
lm_robust(goodroadv ~ post_treat*treatment + lnarea + lnpopden + city + factor(reg8),
          data = data, clusters = id_dist) %>% tidy() %>% filter(term=="post_treat:treatment")

#column2: Commune Has Public Transport as outcome
lm_robust(transport ~ post_treat*treatment + lnarea + lnpopden + city + factor(reg8),
          data = data, clusters = id_dist) %>% tidy() %>% filter(term=="post_treat:treatment")

#Education and Cultural Program
lm_robust(pro4 ~ post_treat*treatment + lnarea + lnpopden + city + factor(reg8),
          data = data, clusters = id_dist) %>% tidy() %>% filter(term=="post_treat:treatment")
```

 - For example, all-year roads have grown about 8\% faster in the treatment than in the control group; Pubic transportation has grown 10\% faster; Education and cultural programs have grown 8\% faster. Recentralization improved public service delivery at least in these areas.

 <br>

### Visual Inspection of Parallel Trends Assumption
 - Since the validity of the DID design rests on the parallel trend assumption, it is critical to evaluate its plausibility. It assumes that the change in $Y$ that would have happened in the treatment group in the absence of treatment is the same as the change in $Y$ in the control group. But the assumption is not empirically testable since it involves counterfactual outcomes: $\E[Y_0(1) - Y_0(0) \mid D=1, X=x] = \E[Y_0(1)-Y_0(0) \mid D=0, X=x]$.

 - One simple way to investigate it is to simply visualize "trends" using data for prior periods (2006 data in this case) as a placebo test.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
malesky2014 <- malesky2014 %>% mutate(group=as.factor(ifelse(treatment==1, "Treat", "Control")))

#make a function for plot
trend_plot = function(data=data, outcome, ...) {
  group_mean <- data %>% group_by(year, treatment, group) %>% summarize(y = mean(!!outcome))
  ggplot(group_mean, aes(y=y, x=year, color=group)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(aes(linetype=group)) +
    scale_linetype_manual(breaks=c("Control", "Treat"), values=c(5,1)) +
    geom_vline(xintercept=2009, linetype="dashed") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = sort(unique(data$year))) +
    #labs(title = outcome, x = "Year", y = "Group Mean of Outcome") +
    theme_bw()
}

#does outcome have parallel trends in pre-treatment periods (2006-2008)?
trend_plot(data=malesky2014, outcome = quo(goodroadv)) #All-Year Road: not at all
trend_plot(data=malesky2014, outcome = quo(pro4)) #Education and Cultural Program: seems parallel
```

 <br>
 <br>

# (Optional) Extension: Synthetic Controls
 - Motivation: what if we have a lot of control units BUT too few of them are obvious controls for comparison (i.e., none of them seems to have a parallel trend with treated unit)?
 
 - "Synthetic" controls: then we construct a hypothetical control unit by choosing a weighted combination of existing control units! The weights are computed so that the hypothetical control units satisfy not just parallel trends with the treated unit before treatment, but that it is identical to your pre-treatment covariates.

 - A brief theory
     + One treated unit, say $i=1$, receives the treatment at time $T$
     + Quantity of interest is $Y_{1T} - \underbrace{Y_{1T}(0)}_{\text{counterfactual}}$
     + Build a synthetic control using past outcomes
     + The weighted average of controls (w/o covariates case): $$\widehat{Y_{1T}}(0) = \sum_{i=2}^{n} \hat{w_i} Y_{iT},$$ where the weights are computed to minimize the imbalance of pre-treatment outcomes $$\hat{w} = \underset{w}{\text{argmin}} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \left( Y_{1t} - \sum_{i=2}^N w_iY_{it} \right)^2,$$ subject to $\sum_{i=2}^N \hat{w}_i=1$ and $\hat{w}_i \geq 0$.
     + The key assumption is that the weights can "balance" the unobserved confounders as well as the observed covariates (of course, it's untestable) 
 
### Synth in R
 - We'll use `Synth` package.
 
 - The empirical example (provided in the package!) is a dataset of Spanish regional economic development (Abadie and Gardeazabal [2003](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/000282803321455188)) 
 
 - Question: does violent conflict harm economic development?
 
 - Variables
     + Outcome ($Y$): GDP per capita
     + Treatment ($D$): 1 (treated) if Basque Country which experienced political terrorism in the 1970s, 0 (control) other Spanish countries
     + Treatment timing ($T$): 1 if in 1970-1997, 0 if in 1960-1969
     
 - A simple pre-post comparisons are problematic because it is unclear what other shocks might produce a change in trend; a diff-in-diff might seem appealing but it would be difficult to claim parallel trends and the control pool is too small to draw from.
 

```{r}
library(Synth)
data(basque) #loading a dataset included in package
basque %>% count(regionname) %>% head()
```

Each row is an observation-year and we have 43 years for each country, so "balanced" panel data.

```{r}
unique(basque[, 1:2])
```

What is the treated group? 17 is Basque Country (Pais Vasco).

```{r}
# First Synth step: Tell Synth to cut up your data
prepared_data <- dataprep(
  basque,
  unit.variable = "regionno",
  time.variable = "year",
  predictors = "gdpcap", #which predictors (covariates) we are going to weight on
  dependent = "gdpcap", #outcome variable
  treatment.identifier = 17, #treatment group is Region #17
  time.predictors.prior = 1960:1969,
  time.optimize.ssr = 1960:1969,
  time.plot = 1955:1997, #what years to plot in a subsequent plot
  controls.identifier = c(2:16, 18) #control group (Region 1 is national data for all of Spain)
)
unique(basque$regionname)
model_1 <- synth(data.prep.obj = prepared_data, optimxmethod = "BFGS")
```

"BFGS" is just a optimization algorithm (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno), which you'll see in MLE course again. We can see the weights given to the controls! So our control unit would be $$1.4\% \text{ Andalucia} + \cdots +3.8 \% \text{ Cataluna} + \cdots + 68.7\% \text{ Madrid} + \cdots.$$

We can plot the trajectories of treated and control groups, matching on pre-treatment outcomes.

```{r}
#famous plotting
plot_data <- tibble(control = (prepared_data$Y0plot %*% model_1$solution.w), #weighted combination
                    treated = prepared_data$Y1plot,
                    years = c(1955:1997))
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x=years, y = treated)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype ="Basque (Treated)")) +
  geom_line(aes(x= years, y=control, linetype ="Synthetic Control")) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1970, color = "Treatment Begins")) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Year", y="GDP per capita") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

Or, we can plot just the divergence of them.

```{r}
plot_data$diff <- plot_data$treated - plot_data$control
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x=years, y = diff)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = "Diff: Treat- Synth Control")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept= 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1970, color = "Begin Treatment")) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Year", y="GDP per capita") +
  ggtitle("Difference in Treated and Synth Control Trend") + 
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

Here we see the gap is a little more severe; within a few years of the beginning of hostilities, the Basque Country region has fallen half a log-income unit behind the synthetic control. We can get numerical differences as well.

```{r}
# Create numerical gaps between treated and synthetic control
gaps <- prepared_data$Y1plot - (prepared_data$Y0plot %*% model_1$solution.w)

# Subset to just the years after treatment
minimum_number = (1970 - 1955) + 1
gaps[minimum_number:length(gaps), ]
```

Let's do a placebo test: apply the same technique to Catalonia, a region similar to the Basque Country but with a much lower exposure to terrorism. Can we find similar treatment effects?

```{r}
placebo_data <- dataprep(
  basque,
  unit.variable = "regionno",
  time.variable = "year",
  predictors = "gdpcap", #which predictors (covariates) we are going to weight on
  dependent = "gdpcap", #outcome variable
  treatment.identifier = 10, #suppose treatment group is Region #10 (Cataluna)
  time.predictors.prior = 1960:1969,
  time.optimize.ssr = 1960:1969,
  time.plot = 1955:1997, #what years to plot in a subsequent plot
  controls.identifier = c(2:9, 11:18) #control group (Region 1 is national data for all of Spain)
)

model_placebo <- synth(data.prep.obj = placebo_data, method = "BFGS")
plot_data3 <- tibble(treated = placebo_data$Y1plot,
                     control = (placebo_data$Y0plot %*% model_placebo$solution.w), #weighted combination
                     years = c(1955:1997))
ggplot(plot_data3, aes(x=years, y = treated)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype ="Cataluna (Placebo)")) +
  geom_line(aes(x= years, y=control, linetype ="Synthetic Control")) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1970, color = "Treatment Begins")) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Year", y="GDP per capita") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

So far, we used only outcome variable. As the dataset contains a bunch of observed confounders, so let's use them.

```{r}
full_prep_data <- dataprep(
  basque, #dataset
  predictors = c("school.illit", "school.prim", "school.med", 
                 "school.high", "school.post.high", "invest"), #covariates available for whole period
  time.predictors.prior = 1964:1969,
  special.predictors = list( #covariates whose time availability differs
    list("gdpcap", 1960:1969, "mean"),
    list("sec.agriculture", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.energy", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.industry", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.construction", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.services.venta", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("sec.services.nonventa", seq(1961, 1969, 2), "mean"),
    list("popdens", 1969, "mean")
  ),
  dependent = "gdpcap",
  unit.variable = "regionno",
  time.variable = "year",
  treatment.identifier = 17,
  controls.identifier = c(2:16, 18),
  time.optimize.ssr = 1960:1969,
  time.plot = 1955:1997
)

#then run model
model_2 <- synth(data.prep.obj = full_prep_data, method = "BFGS")

#plot
plot_data2 <- tibble(treated = full_prep_data$Y1plot,
                     control = (full_prep_data$Y0plot %*% model_2$solution.w), #weighted combination
                     years = c(1955:1997))
ggplot(plot_data2, aes(x=years, y = treated)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype ="Basque (Treated)")) +
  geom_line(aes(x= years, y=control, linetype ="Synthetic Control")) + 
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1970, color = "Treatment Begins")) + 
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x="Year", y="GDP per capita") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")
```

Here, we see an even more pronounced effect on a model that we think might be better identified: because it allows for more pre-treatment information (from covariates) to construct the synthetic controls, which can be seen in the better trajectory balance between treated and synthetic control. We've learned that a long running regional civil war is bad for economic development.
